# StarWars

I created a webpage displaying models from the Star Wars API

https://swapi.dev

I used GitHub Pages to host the website.

```Live Demo can be viewed here:```

## Steps: 

1. The main page will display all people and films from Star Wars API. The "Name" button can be clicked, and once you click on the name, it will redirect you to the person page where it will show detailed information about that person and films he/she was in.
2. Inside the people page, you can also click on the "Films" buttons, where it will have the list of films that person was in. It will have the title of the movie, episodes, and all other detailed information about the film.
3. Inside the film page, you can see a list of characters. Each "Character" button can be clicked, and once you click on it, it will redirect you to the characters page that was in that movie. 
4. If you want to navigate to the main page, you can always click on "StarWars" Logo on the top left corner, and it will redirect you from any page you are on, to the main Home page.
5. On the main page, you will also have the option to click on "Films" button, this will redirect you to the film page, and it will have the same structure set up as in step 3. 

Please note: If you don't see anything displayed on the page, please wait couple more seconds for data to be loaded, because sometimes fetching from Star Wars API takes time.
